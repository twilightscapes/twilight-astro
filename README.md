## üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è PIRATE Social

PIRATE is not your typical social network. It's a decentralized network of individualy owned personal websites acting together as a new social content distribution model.

Here's how it works: instead of relying on a central platform, PIRATE leverages the power of Netlify and GitHub to utelize their free services for hosting your own platorm. Your individual website becomes your hub for social interactions on both PIRATE and other social media. The content you produce, you fully own and control the rights to.

More than just a collection of individual websites, PIRATE uses the magic of RSS feeds, you can enjoy a central timeline that aggregates posts from across the network. You get to see what others are sharing, discover new voices, and engage in meaningful conversations.

Your PIRATE website is actually a Progressive Web App (PWA), which means you can access it seamlessly from any of your devices. Being a PWA also means there are no App Stores to worry about!

PIRATE gives you the tools to easily edit your homepage, update your profile, and publish engaging posts. It's super easy to get started, without any complicated technical barriers.

## Setup

- With PIRATE, there is no need to muck around in code files just to configure and setup your site.
- All set up and control is done through the built-in CMS. 
- In order to to do so online, you will need to create a free account @ [KeyStatic Cloud](https://keystatic.cloud)
- Connect your Keystatic account to your Github repo
<!-- - Copy/paste the Keystatic project settings into your Netlify Env Variables -->
- Copy and Paste the Keystatic Cloud project settings you are given into this file:     [https://github.com/YourGitAccount/YourRepo/edit/main/keystatic.config.ts](https://github.com/piratesocial/pirate/edit/main/keystatic.config.ts)
Edit this file on line 7 - replace "pirate/pirate" with your project settings from Keystatic Cloud.
- Redeploy your site on Netlify and then go to yoursite.netlify.app/admin to login to the CMS and configure the rest of your site.

## Using Local Development

 You can edit and make updates through the cloud with the [KeyStatic](https://keystatic.com) CMS outlined above, or you can install it locally with the options listed below. You can use both and PIRATE will detect which one you are using: cloud or local.
